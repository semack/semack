I am a seasoned IT professional with over 30 years of experience in software development and related fields. I have a strong passion for technology, which began in the mid-eighties with programming on ZX Spectrum and PDP-11 compatible microcomputers. Throughout my career, I have held various roles, including Software Engineer, Tech Lead, Project Manager, Software Architect, Delivery Manager, and DevOps. My expertise lies in Pre-sales, Analysis, Decomposition, Estimations, building Architectures, and Deployments, as well as being familiar with the full SDLC in practice.

As a community-focused individual, I have created and led several local IT initiatives, such as establishing a local IT Museum and an IT Hub. Additionally, I developed a mentoring program within my current company, which I continue to oversee. My interests lie in researching new technologies, R&D, and engaging in challenging projects and experiments.

I am seeking opportunities in the following positions: CTO, Researcher (R&D), DevRel, or Engineering Manager. My passion for technology drives me to continually innovate and contribute to the IT industry.
